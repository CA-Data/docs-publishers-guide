# Introduction

## Who this is for

This handbook is for California State employees that want to publish open data on the [State’s Open Data Portal](https://data.ca.gov).

{% hint style="warning" %}
The guidance on uploading and publishing data only applies to direct publishing on [https://data.ca.gov](https://data.ca.gov). However, the rest of the guidance establishes **minimum** expectations for all California open data publishing.

## How this is organized

Publishing a new open dataset takes some planning and coordination, but it doesn’t have to be difficult. This handbook is designed to provide a reference guide you can return to and take piece by piece as you move through the process.

The handbook is divided into sections that correspond to a general publishing process. The diagram below shows those steps and links to guidance for each step. The pre-publishing checklist pulls up the most important considerations when getting started to minimize surprises during your journey.

If you have questions, you can ask them in the [CalData Communities Open Data Community.](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a037b34f454d94a9fa7f6aa964c052af4%40thread.tacv2/Open%20Data?groupId=0f45987a-e632-4e93-be66-ebfd6079e926\&tenantId=68a88534-151d-4e79-8046-09be7890656c)

2. [**Consolidate and merge raw data.**](broken-reference) If you are producing a dataset that requires consolidation of multiple sources (e.g. data from multiple counties), some guidelines on approaching that to minimize errors.
3. [**Simplify and clean data.**](reference-and-additional-documents/simplify-and-clean-data.md) Guidance on what makes a clean dataset and tips on how to get to clean data. Does not include exhaustive consideration of all data quality issues.
4. [**Create metadata and data dictionary.**](create-metadata-and-data-dictionary.md) Guidance on what minimum metadata and documentation is needed to make the dataset useful to others.
5. [**Upload the dataset.**](upload-the-dataset.md) Guidance on uploading the dataset to the open data portal.
6. [**Get publishing approval.**](get-publishing-approval.md) Guidance on getting final approval to make the dataset publicly available.
