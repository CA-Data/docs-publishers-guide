This section covers format and structure standards for datasets being shared with others. These standards are designed to make sure that field level information is shared as consistently as possible to minimize:

1. Errors
2. Rework
3. Repetitive questions

This reference covers:

1. [Column headers and order](column-headers-and-order.md)
2. [Date and time formats](date-and-time.md)
3. [Text formats](text.md)
4. [Numeric formats](numeric.md)
5. [Address formats](addresses.md)

This section is adopted from [guidance published by DataSF](https://datasf.gitbook.io/draft-publishing-standards/data-structure-and-formats/formats) with many thanks to [Singapore's Open Data Program for providing a Data Quality Guide for Tabular Data](https://github.com/datagovsg/data-quality). The bulk of which made its way into this section with additions and modifications.&#x20;
