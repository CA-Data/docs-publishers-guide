# Addresses

## Why valid addresses matter

* Consistent formatting of valid addresses is important for accurately mapping and referencing geographic information
* A poorly formed address could end up mapping to the wrong geographic reference or not at all, reducing the usefulness of the data
* Poorly formed addresses can make cleanup of data labor intensive and result in reporting errors where geography (neighborhoods, census, etc.) is concerned
* Poorly formed addresses could also result in additional costs because of things like:
  * Undeliverable/returned mail
  * Failure to apply benefits to recipients appropriately based on geography
  * Poor routing of vehicles or people in the field
