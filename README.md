# Introduction

## Who the handbook is for

This handbook is for California State employees that want to publish open data on the [State’s Open Data Portal](https://data.ca.gov).

{% hint style="warning" %}
The guidance on uploading and publishing data only applies to direct publishing on [https://data.ca.gov](https://data.ca.gov). However, the rest of the guidance establishes **minimum** expectations for preparing data for publishing.

[You can see a list of State organizations that maintain their own open data portals](reference-and-additional-documents/jason-add-reference-to-orgs-that-have-different-publishing.md). Reach out to your portal administrator or data coordinator if you have questions about publishing on those portals.
{% endhint %}

## How to use the handbook

Publishing a new open dataset takes some planning and coordination, but it doesn’t have to be difficult. This handbook is designed to provide a reference guide you can return to as you go.

**Get started by:**

1. Skimming the handbook to familiarize yourself with its content
2. Starting immediately with the pre-publishing checklist
3. Bookmarking and coming back as you move through getting your data ready for publishing

## How the handbook is organized

The handbook is divided into sections that line up to a general publishing process. The diagram below shows those steps and they are repeated in a list below with links to the sections.

If you have questions you can ask them in the [CalData Communities Open Data Community.](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a037b34f454d94a9fa7f6aa964c052af4%40thread.tacv2/Open%20Data?groupId=0f45987a-e632-4e93-be66-ebfd6079e926\&tenantId=68a88534-151d-4e79-8046-09be7890656c)
