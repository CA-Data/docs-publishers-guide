## **Checklist**

* [ ] Create a document to capture your specific data preparation steps, should include but not be limited to:
  * [ ] Relevant contact information for sources and update process
  * [ ] Names of relevant data sources
  * [ ] Repeatable steps for completing your data preparation&#x20;
  * [ ] Link to example sources and output for reference
  * [ ] A change log table that includes a list of substantive changes and dates of those changes starting with the initial creation date
* [ ] If merging tables from multiple sources (like counties or regions)
  * [ ] Check all expected fields are accounted for across data sources
  * [ ] Check the same number of rows exist in your merged dataset
* [ ] Check that data types are consistent within fields in your dataset. For example if the field is supposed to be an integer, that it does not contain non-numeric text.
* [ ] Save your data file as a delimited file such as CSV
