# ðŸ”„ 6. Update and Maintain the Dataset

Some framing on the definitions of manual and automated updates.

Data on the open data portals must be kept up-to-date. Specific guidance regarding updates should be addressed in technical and working documents as they are developed. Each organization should be responsible for updates to their data based on their internal data governance model. Periodic internal review is highly recommended.&#x20;

The posting frequency for updates is included in the metadata for each data table and indicates how often the data table will be refreshed (e.g., annually, monthly, daily).

## Manual updates

* [ ] Ensure that you have documented easily replicable instructions for how someone could access and update the dataset
* [ ] Ensure that there exists a plan of action for who would manage the dataset and help address issues after you, for example on moving to a new department or leaving State service

## Automated updates

* [ ] that your dataset update steps are captured and annotated through an automated process (e.g. scripts or ETL/ELT platform)
