# ðŸ”¼ 4. Upload the Dataset

This section provides instructions on how to upload a dataset. You can refer to the page on detailed steps for uploading data to the portal for deeper guidance.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**The following only applies to publishing directly on** [**https://data.ca.gov**](https://data.ca.gov)**.**

If you publish to another portal, please follow the directions provided by your State organization. [You can refer to the list of state organizations with their own portals](reference-and-additional-documents/jason-add-reference-to-orgs-that-have-different-publishing.md).
{% endhint %}

:mega: **Help us build guidance on geospatial data publishing**

This page does not yet address the specific details of publishing data on a geo portal (e.g. [https://gis.data.ca.gov](https://gis.data.ca.gov)). [Sign up to give feedback and input as we develop guidance](https://airtable.com/shrvIiRHxyAAEsq41).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**All reviewers must have accounts on data.ca.gov to review the private dataset**

If you haven't checked, make sure all reviewers have access to publishing within your organization on the portal. If you need to request access, [contact the open data team](mailto:opendata@state.ca.gov?subject=\[publisher\_handbook]%20Requesting%20publisher%20permissions%20on%20data.ca.gov).
