# Organizations with separate open data portals

### Organizations that publish on separate portals

If you are in one of the following State organizations, you should start with publishing open data directly through your agency’s open data portal:

* [Board of Equalization](https://www.boe.ca.gov/dataportal/)
* [Controller’s Office](https://bythenumbers.sco.ca.gov/browse)
* [Department of Justice](https://openjustice.doj.ca.gov/data)
* [Department of Tax and Fee Administration](https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/DataPortal/index.htm)
* [Employment Development Department](https://data.edd.ca.gov)
* [Franchise Tax Board](https://data.ftb.ca.gov)
* [Health and Human Services Agency](https://data.chhs.ca.gov)
* [Natural Resources Agency](https://data.cnra.ca.gov)
* [Treasurer’s Office](https://debtwatch.treasurer.ca.gov)

Please reach out to your data coordinator for any specific guidance if you are in any of the above organizations, but the guidance below is generalizable across the State and sets the minimum expectations for publishing open data.

When publishing to your organization’s portal, in many cases[\[2\]](../broken-reference/), those datasets will be automatically included and discoverable from the statewide open data portal through a process called harvesting (don’t worry, you don’t need to worry about how harvesting works to publish open data).
