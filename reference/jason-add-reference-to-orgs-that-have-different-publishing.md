Please reach out to your data coordinator or portal administrator for any specific guidance. You should still prepare data in line with this handbook, even though you'll publish to a different portal.

When publishing to your organization’s portal, in many cases, those datasets will be "harvested" automatically so they are discoverable through the [California Open Data Portal](https://data.ca.gov) (you don’t need to know exactly how harvesting works to publish open data).
