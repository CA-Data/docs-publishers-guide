# Introduction

## Who the handbook is for

This handbook is for California State employees that want to publish open data on the State’s Open Data Portal ([https://data.ca.gov](https://data.ca.gov))

{% hint style="warning" %}
The guidance on uploading and publishing data (sections [4](broken-reference) and [5](broken-reference)) only applies to direct publishing on [https://data.ca.gov](https://data.ca.gov). However, the rest of the guidance establishes **minimum** expectations for preparing data for publishing.

[You can see a list of State organizations that maintain their own open data portals](reference/jason-add-reference-to-orgs-that-have-different-publishing.md). Reach out to your portal administrator or data coordinator if you have questions about publishing on those portals.

****:mega: **Help us build guidance on geospatial data publishing**

This guide does not yet address the specific details of publishing data on a geo portal (e.g. [https://gis.data.ca.gov](https://gis.data.ca.gov)). [Sign up to give feedback and input as we develop guidance](https://airtable.com/shrvIiRHxyAAEsq41).
{% endhint %}

## :mega: Feedback and questions welcome

This guidance will evolve and grow with feedback. Throughout, we've called out opportunities for feedback on additional guidance indicated with a megaphone emoji (:mega:).&#x20;

If you feel stuck or have general questions, we encourage you to ask questions through the [CalData Communities Open Data Channel in Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a037b34f454d94a9fa7f6aa964c052af4%40thread.tacv2/Open%20Data?groupId=0f45987a-e632-4e93-be66-ebfd6079e926\&tenantId=68a88534-151d-4e79-8046-09be7890656c). This allows everyone in the community to benefit from the question. If you are not a member yet and are a State employee, [you can sign up here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=NIWoaB0VeU6ARgm-eJBlbP8EsQ790KZKrhPJ1tkPH1JURjFWN1paMUtURFU5TFZOSjdTNVFZMkxEQi4u).

## A definition of open data

Before diving in, it's important to understand a common definition of open data. This handbook guides you through publishing in a way that is consistent with this definition.

The Open Knowledge Foundation has developed a standard open data and content definition. In it's short f

**Open data is data that can be freely used, shared and built-on by anyone, anywhere, for any purpose.**

Building on this, open data:

1. **Is openly licensed.** In California, data _must_ be in the Public Domain.
2. **Is accessible.** In California, data _must_ be published to an official State open data portal without restrictions.
3. **Is machine readable.** Data _must_ be provided in a form readily processable by a computer and where the individual elements of the work can be easily accessed and modified.
4. **Is in an open format.** Data _must_ be provided in an open format. An open format is one which places no restrictions, monetary or otherwise, upon its use and can be fully processed with at least one free/libre/open-source software tool.

We've provided more detail on what is open data, what is not open data

## How to use the handbook

Publishing a new open dataset takes some planning and coordination, but it doesn’t have to be difficult. This handbook is designed to provide a reference guide you can return to as you go.

**Get started by:**

1. Skimming the handbook to familiarize yourself with its content
2. Starting immediately [with the pre-publishing checklist](broken-reference)
3. Bookmarking and coming back as you move through getting your data ready for publishing

## How the handbook is organized

The handbook is divided into sections that line up to a general publishing process. The diagram below shows those steps and are listed down below with links to each section.

If you have questions you can ask them in the [CalData Communities Open Data Community.](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a037b34f454d94a9fa7f6aa964c052af4%40thread.tacv2/Open%20Data?groupId=0f45987a-e632-4e93-be66-ebfd6079e926\&tenantId=68a88534-151d-4e79-8046-09be7890656c)

**Publishing process steps**

1. [**Review the pre-publishing checklist.**](broken-reference) Summarizes things to get started on and be aware of early in the process to minimize surprises later on.
2. ****[**Prepare data for publishing.**](2.-prepare-data-for-publishing.md) Guidance on preparing your dataset for publishing including identifying and implementing any necessary cleaning and merging of data as needed.
3. [**Create metadata and data dictionary.**](broken-reference) Guidance on minimum metadata and documentation needed to make the dataset useful to others.
4. [**Upload the dataset.**](broken-reference) Guidance on uploading the dataset to the open data portal for those publishing directly to data.ca.gov.
5. [**Get final publishing approval.**](broken-reference) Guidance on getting final approval to make the dataset publicly available.
6. [**Update and maintain the dataset.**](broken-reference) Guidance on ways to make sure the dataset is updated and maintained appropriately.
