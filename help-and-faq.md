| Data Steward                              | The Data Steward is the person most knowledgeable about the data including the sources, collection methods, and limitations. The Data Steward should be able to write metadata describing the data and answer questions about the data or the program the data derives from. The Data Steward cleans, uploads, and edits the data of a [group](https://data.ca.gov/open-data-glossary#group) on [Data.ca.gov](https://data.ca.gov) and communicates with the [Data Coordinator](https://data.ca.gov/open-data-glossary#data\_coordinator) for publishing approval. Sometimes, the Data Steward is also the [Data Coordinator](https://data.ca.gov/open-data-glossary#data\_coordinator), who has authority to publish the data.

| Executive Sponsor                         | Within the California [Open Data](https://data.ca.gov/open-data-glossary#opendata) Portal program, the Executive Sponsor role is a director-level position or an organization’s executive who has the authority to recommend, approve and publicize data collected by the state entity they represent. The Executive Sponsor identifies a [Data Coordinator](https://data.ca.gov/open-data-glossary#data\_coordinator) to carry out the vetting and publishing of their organization’s data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Flatten / Flat Files                      | A flat file is an informal term for a single table of data from which all word processing or other structure characters or markup have been removed. A flat file stores data in plain text format. Because of their simple structure, flat files can only be read, stored and sent. CSV files are one of the most common types of flat files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Data Reviewer                             | Data Reviewer provides a comprehensive set of quality control (QC) tools that enable an efficient and consistent data review process. This includes tools that support both automated and semiautomated analysis of data to detect errors in a feature's integrity, attribution, or spatial relationships with other features. Errors detected during analysis are stored to facilitate corrective workflows and data quality reporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)            | <p>ETL is a type of data integration that consists of three steps (extract, transform, load) used to blend data from multiple sources. During this process, data is taken (extracted) from a source, converted (transformed) into a format that can be analyzed, and stored (loaded) into a data warehouse or other system.</p><p>ETL is an alternative to the ELT process (see below).</p><p>Read <a href="https://blog.panoply.io/etl-vs-elt-the-difference-is-in-the-how">this article for more information on the differences between ELT and ETL</a>.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Extract, Load, Transform (ELT)            | <p>ELT is the process of extracting data from one or multiple sources and loading it into a data warehouse.

| Harvesting                                | <p>Harvesting is a process where the data portal automatically imports (“harvests”) datasets from multiple CKAN websites and other non-CKAN sources into a single CKAN website. This automated process is what enables the statewide portal to contain data from other agency and department portals. To harvest a source catalog, there must be a public interface to a data file that represents the catalog in a <a href="https://resources.data.gov/resources/dcat-us/">DCAT-US compliant format</a>.</p><p>The harvests are set up and monitored by system administrators of the portals. It is not something a publisher needs to worry about when publishing.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Machine Readable                          | <p>Information or data that is in a format that can be easily processed by a computer without human intervention. To be machine readable, data must be structured in an organized way. <a href="https://data.ca.gov/open-data-glossary#csv">CSV</a>, <a href="https://data.ca.gov/open-data-glossary#json">JSON</a>, and <a href="https://data.ca.gov/open-data-glossary#XML">XML</a> among others, are formats that contain structured data that a computer can automatically read and process.</p><p>Non-digital materials such as photos and handwritten documents are not machine readable even when scanned. For example, a <a href="https://data.ca.gov/open-data-glossary#pdf">PDF</a> document containing tables of data is digital but is not machine-readable because the tables are still simply images.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
