        <p>ETL is a type of data integration that consists of three steps (extract,

          into a format that can be analyzed, and stored (loaded) into a data warehouse
          or other system.</p>
        <p>ETL is an alternative to the ELT process (see below).</p>

        <p>For example, in a database table, each field is in a column and the field
          name is the name you give to the columns in the table. The name should
          indicate what data is contained in each column.

          datasets from multiple CKAN websites and other non-CKAN sources into a
          single CKAN website. This automated process is what enables the statewide
          portal to contain data from other agency and department portals. To harvest
          a source catalog, there must be a public interface to a data file that
          represents the catalog in a <a href="https://resources.data.gov/resources/dcat-us/">DCAT-US compliant format</a>.</p>
        <p>The harvests are set up and monitored by system administrators of the
          portals. It is not something a publisher needs to worry about when publishing.</p>

        <p>Non-digital materials such as photos and handwritten documents are not

          containing tables of data is digital but is not machine-readable because
          the tables are still simply images.</p>
