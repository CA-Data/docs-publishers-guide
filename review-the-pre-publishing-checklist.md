# 1. Review the Pre-Publishing Checklist

## Identify your publishing team

It takes a team to deliver high quality open data. There are 3 roles that will serve you well in making sure publishing moves forward. They are pictured below and described in the checklist following. In some cases a single person may fulfill multiple roles, but you shouldn't be on your own entirely.

### Find the person that fills each of the following roles

* [ ] **Data Coordinator.** The person in your organization that acts as the laiason among teams for moving open data forward.
* [ ] **Data Steward.** The person that has knowledge about the data itself and meaning around the data.
* [ ] **Data Custodian. **The person that understands the technical dimensions of how the data being published is stored, secured, and accessed.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Others may be needed as you move through the process**

These three roles are core, but you may need to bring in others as you move through publishing and approval. If you have these 3 roles represented at the start, then you should have everything you need to pull in the right people at the right time.
{% endhint %}

### &#x20;Form your team

* [ ] **Send a link to this handbook to the people you've identified.** Give them a heads up you'll be working on publishing - you can use this email template as a starting point.



## Start documenting your dataset

## Identify resource needs



The pre-publishing checklist identifies the things you should consider at the beginning of your journey and can help you scope the level of effort your dataset may take to finalize.

*   [ ] Have you taken the open data training offered by the Department of Technology?

    * [ ] **Yes** - go on to the next item
    * [ ] **No** - [send an email to the open data team](mailto:opendata@state.ca.gov?subject=Open%20data%20training%20request\&body=Note:%20Please%20include%20any%20other%20staff%20from%20your%20organization%20that%20will%20be%20involved%20in%20helping%20publish%20data) to set up a training session. Include others at your organization that will be involved in publishing or may publish in the future.


*   [ ] Is your data coordinator aware of publishing the dataset and has your organization given approval to begin?

    * [ ] **Yes** - go on to the next item
    * [ ] **No, and I know who to talk to** - reach out to your data coordinator and make sure you’re following your organization’s approval process for publishing
    * [ ] **No, but I don’t know who to talk to** **- \<ACTION TBD pending>**

    ****
* [ ] Does the source data include personally identifiable information (PII) or personal health information (PHI)?
  * [ ] **Yes** - identify guidance for handling PII or PHI in your department or agency and follow it when preparing data for publishing. This guidance may be available through your Information Security Office, Privacy Office or equivalent.
  * [ ] **No** - go on to the next item



*   [ ] Have you defined the output format for the dataset which includes the names and types of each field?

    * [ ] **Yes** - go on to the next item
    *   [ ] **No** - develop a sample data [format](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1CHJuE89yiNUHsxrjQxseMmxRWDAs11M4/edit) [using the metadata template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1CHJuE89yiNUHsxrjQxseMmxRWDAs11M4/edit) (in Excel).

        * [ ] Review [a list of open data standards provided by GovEx](http://datastandards.directory). If there’s an applicable standard, we suggest using or expanding on the standard.&#x20;

        **Note:** The template can be used as reference in [step 3. Simplify and clean data](reference-and-additional-documents/simplify-and-clean-data.md) and in developing your documentation in [step 4. Create metadata and data dictionary](create-metadata-and-data-dictionary.md). Publishing a data dictionary is required.


* [ ] Do you have the resources to update the dataset at the target update frequency either manually or through automation? Consider the following:
  * [ ] If your dataset requires cleaning and/or merging of multiple sources, you or your organization can reproduce the steps to do so while meeting the update frequency.
  * [ ] If updating data automatically, you have access to the technical resources to do so.
  * [ ] If updating data manually, you can easily hand off responsibility to a colleague as needed, including necessary documentation to reproduce the dataset.
