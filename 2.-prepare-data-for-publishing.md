# ðŸ“ˆ 2. Prepare Data for Publishing

Some intro thingy....

## Consolidate and merge raw data&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Not all datasets require consolidation and merging**

This section is for those that have multiple data submissions from separate entities (e.g. counties, regional governments, continuums of care, etc.) or otherwise need to merge tables into a single table. Ideally the input data are already standardized, though we've included some checks below.

If you don't have multiple spreadsheets or tables that need to be collapsed into a single table, you can [skip to simplifying and standardizing](2.-prepare-data-for-publishing.md#simplify-and-standardize-data).
{% endhint %}

Consolidating data refers to the gathering of existing datasets from multiple sources (e.g. counties, regional governments, continuums of care, etc). It is important to ensure that each variable is processed and documented in the same way across these datasets. This makes it easier for users to understand the consolidated data and for the data producers to create a consistent dataset. ****&#x20;

We are not prescriptive about how you merge data as that varies by tool. Please consult documentation or peers for specific technical questions regarding merging data. **Regardless of approach, adopt one that is repeatable by you and others.**

Below is a general checklist of items to be mindful of as you consolidate multiple sources of data.

### General Checklist

* [ ] Conduct a preliminary assessment of your datasets to prepare for merging&#x20;
  * [ ] Record the number of rows you have across sources to validate your final dataset&#x20;
  * [ ] Check that each column of data contains a single data type (for example, if the column contains numeric data, it does not have text codes mixed in). Follow this detailed guidance for addressing mixed data types if you have them.
  * [ ] Check that columns have the same named headers in each table. Follow this detailed guidance if you
* [ ] Quality check your merged data output&#x20;
  * [ ] Check whether the number of rows in merged dataset match the number of rows across sources&#x20;
  * [ ] Ensure that numerical fields in merged datasets match with source datasets
  * [ ] Identify fields where there are rows with no values to check if data was dropped as a result of your merge logic&#x20;
  * [ ] Check if dataset is inclusive of the full population represented across datasets
  * [ ] Ensure that categories are consistent across sources

## Simplify and standardize data &#x20;

In some cases, you may receive a dataset and not have direct control over how itâ€™s put together. Work closely with anyone that is involved in the preparation of data for publishing and share this section to ensure data is usable.

The considerations in here are general across datasets but not exhaustive. Please use your professional judgment to simplify and standardize the data that youâ€™re publishing.

### **General checklist**

* [ ] De-identify data if necessary. Refer to guidance issued by your privacy or legal office.
* [ ] Determine data format and quality check the dataset
* [ ] Check dataset for appropriate formatting for use on the open data portal
* [ ] Saving your dataset for publishing on the open data portal

### :page\_with\_curl: Reformatting examples

Below in the tabs are 2 examples of reformatting a dataset

**Example 1.** Demonstrates cleaning up a dataset from improper date format to machine-readable date format by first removing blank cells in columns, then creating a date column, then replacing the old format with the new, single column with a header of 'date' at the top of the column.

**Example 2.** compares a long formatted dataset to a wide formatted dataset. A long formatted dataset is machine-readable, a wide-formatted dataset is less so.
